# HCL

https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl

The goal of HCL is to build a structured configuration language that is both human and machine friendly for use with command-line tools, but specifically targeted towards DevOps tools, servers, etc.

Our goal with HCL is not to alienate other configuration languages. It is instead to provide HCL as a specialized language for our tools, and JSON as the interoperability layer.

## notes

* fully JSON compatible
* heavily inspired by libucl, nginx configuration, and others similar.
